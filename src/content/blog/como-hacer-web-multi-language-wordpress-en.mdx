Hello world 🤟🏻 my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where we return to development, though not so much programming but rather WordPress!

WordPress is used by 65% of websites that use content management systems (CMS), which represents 43% of the Internet.

And one of the reasons why a multi-language website is created is, obviously, to reach as many readers as possible. Your audience will be maximized.

Before we begin, as it couldn't be otherwise, if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you go watch the latest video I have on my YouTube channel where I explained, in a very simple and concise way, how to install a smart light bulb 🧠 with which you can change its color, control it with your own voice, and much more! You can watch it here 👇🏻

Now let's begin:

**1️⃣ FIRST STEP 1️⃣**

The first thing we're going to do is select one of the available plugins in WordPress to create our multi-language website.

The three most famous ones are:

- [Translatepress](https://translatepress.com/)
- [WPML](https://wpml.org/es/)
- [Polylang](https://polylang.pro/)

We can compare what each one offers us, their pros and cons, and which one might suit us better. In my case, I'll use Translatepress, although you can keep following this tutorial if you use any other one since the base is the same.

**2️⃣ SECOND STEP 2️⃣**

Next, we're going to access the administration panel of our WordPress website, commonly accessed at *yourwebsite.com/wp-admin*

**3️⃣ THIRD STEP 3️⃣**

Now, once inside the administration panel, we go to the Plugins section and *add a new plugin*

Then, we search for the name of the plugin we want and install it.

**4️⃣ FOURTH STEP 4️⃣**

Once the plugin is installed, we notice that a new option has been added to the top bar of the administration that says **Translate site**.

Even so, we'll need to previously add a second language to our WordPress.

For that, we go to **Settings > TranslatePress** and add as many languages as we want. In my case, it will only be English.

**5️⃣ FIFTH STEP 5️⃣**

There are mainly two options in almost all translation plugins. Automatic translation and manual translation.

Both have their pros and cons, automatic will be much easier, faster, and more convenient, but of course, they will be translations that, no matter how much AI translation systems improve, will still be insufficient and native readers may find it difficult to understand.

That's why if there are few languages like in this case, it will be better to use manual translation.

We have to click the **Translate site** button that appears at the top of the configuration from the previous step.

This will take us to a kind of WordPress theme editor where we can go, string by string, and translate it.

By clicking on the string we want to translate, we can insert the new translated string.

**Important** to remember that when we're done, we need to click the **Save translation** button.
