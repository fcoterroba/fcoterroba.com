Hello world my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where I'm going to explain how to make a dark mode for your website (or light mode in case your website is already dark) writing 100% explained code. Everything complete 🤓.

Before we begin, I want to thank Mohammad Farmaan for making the [post on dev.to](https://dev.to/mohammadfarmaan/the-best-way-to-dark-mode-your-website-1g7f) and Desiré for sharing it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/helleworld_/status/1280406794662182913). They've been the people who gave me the idea to make this post so, for them! 🤟🏻

It's undeniable that since dark mode became fashionable, many people seek to spend their technological life using this mode and it's true that it has numerous advantages such as:

- If you have a device with an OLED screen, you'll see it much better 👀
- Reduces eye strain
- Helps maintain the battery of our technological devices, by not using so much brightness in color representation 🔋
- etc.

But, in case you don't know yet what dark mode is, I explain that, as its name says, it's a mode that converts all the white of applications, websites, etc.

In Windows 10, for example, dark mode comes by default and, conversely, in one of its latest updates, it put a theme to see the operating system much more light 💡.

A survey by [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/dark-mode-poll-results-1090716/) reveals that more than 80% of surveyed Android users use dark mode in all possible applications. Another survey from the [macrumors](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/poll-dark-mode-yes-or-no.2201456/) forum shows that more than half of users think dark mode is better than light mode. To finish, in a [reddit about Linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/66v3xk/poll_dark_themes_vs_light_themes/) from more than 3 years ago, almost 70% of people already preferred dark mode.

Although it may be counterproductive, I prefer light mode (and I try to make everything I use in my daily life have this mode, even having the possibility to change it and having OLED screens).

Once explained its origin, why the post and my personal opinion, now yes, without giving you more the chat 😂, let's begin 👇🏻.

**CODE**

I'm going to explain Mohammad's, the one exposed before on Dev.to.

Before starting, it's advisable that you have some basic notions of HTML, CSS and JS. But it's not mandatory either, since I'll comment on each line of code used. 🗣

To begin, it's advisable to create the folder we're going to work in as well as its four files (the two styles, the html and the script). 👇🏻

![Project file structure](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

To begin, we're going to write in our html file everything we want to appear on screen, plus a button with the *onclick* attribute pointing to a function we'll write later in Javascript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--This serves to make the browser understand the type of document it's reading-->

<html lang="es"> <!--HTML start tag with attribute to specify the website language-->

    <head> <!--Start tag to establish header values-->

        <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!--Meta tag to establish the encoding to use-->

        <title>Learn to make dark mode with fcoterroba</title> <!--Sets the website title, what appears in the tab-->

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="light.css" id="tema" /> <!--Path to add the css style that will be used by default-->

    </head> <!--Closing of the header tag-->

    <body> <!--Start tag to establish body values-->

        <h1>Try clicking the button to convert all this to dark!</h1> <!--Tag with level 1 heading-->

        <button onclick="cambiarEstilo()">CHANGE!</button> <!--Button to configure later that will change between styles-->

        <script src="switch.js"></script> <!--Script added at the end of the document to perform the style change action-->

    </body> <!--Closing of the body tag-->

</html> <!--End tag of the HTML document-->
```

Once the HTML is done, we move on to configure the main style, light 💡.

```css
h1 { /* We'll establish design rules for level 1 headings */

    font-family: Alef; /* With this rule we can establish the typography */

    font-weight: 150px; /* With this rule we establish the typography size */

    text-align: center; /* With this rule we establish the text in the center of the screen */

    margin-top: 20%; /* This way we'll give it a margin on the top edge of 20% */

}

button { /* We'll establish design rules for buttons */

    padding: 15px; /* Padding size */

    background-color: #241; /* Background color */

    color: white; /* Letter color */

    border: none; /* We remove the button border */

    border-radius: 4px; /* We establish that the border radius is 4 pixels, slightly rounded */

    font-size: 50px; /* Typography size */

}

button:hover { /* We'll establish rules for the button while the mouse is over it */

    background: rgb(236, 202, 9); /* Rule to establish background color */

    color: rgb(255, 255, 255); 

}
```

We now move on to the dark style 🌑, which, really, it's enough to copy and paste the light style, then change the colors and add small things. Leaving something like this ⬇.

```css
h1 {

    font-family: Alef;

    font-weight: 150px;

    text-align: center;

    margin-top: 20%;

    color: white;

}

body{ /* Rule to change everything belonging to the body */

    background: rgb(19, 18, 18);

}

button {

    padding: 15px;

    background-color: #241;

    color: white;

    border: none;

    border-radius: 4px;

    font-size: 50px;

}

 button:hover {

    background: rgb(236, 202, 9);

    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);

}
```

To finish, we'll make the script, which will be, after all, what will perform the style change. 🎨

```javascript
function cambiarEstilo() { /* Declares the function */

    let color = document.getElementById("tema"); /* Creates the color variable assigning the tema value*/

  

    if (color.getAttribute("href") == "light.css") { /* Condition to check that the color value is light, */

      color.href = "dark.css"; /* Sets the dark file */

    } else {

      color.href = "light.css"; /* Sets the light file */

    }

}
```

And with this, our button to change the color mode on our website will be ready! 👨‍💻

I propose a challenge to finish:

> Try to make the color transition much more subtle and not so rough. Establish or add some sweep while performing the style exchange.

I hope your answers in the comments! 😉
