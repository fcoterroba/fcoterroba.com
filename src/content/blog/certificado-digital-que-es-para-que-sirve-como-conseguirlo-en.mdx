Hello world my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where I'm going to explain what the digital certificate is in Spain, what it's for and how we can get it.

**What is the digital certificate?**

The digital certificate is an electronic certification issued by the [National Mint and Stamp Factory – Royal Mint](https://www.sede.fnmt.gob.es/web/sede/inicio) that links its subscriber with signature verification data, thus confirming their identity. This certificate, also known as Citizen or User Certificate, is a digital document that contains your identification data. Thus allowing us to identify ourselves on the Internet and exchange information with other people and organizations with the guarantee that it's us.

The copy-paste is simple, but I'll summarize 😂

The digital certificate is an electronic certification issued by FNMT - RCM that serves us as a kind of "ID card" on the Internet. Having this we'll be able to do the vast majority of things for which, ordinarily, we would have to go to the City Council or competent body.

**Oh, really? What else can you do?**

Well, let me see, the digital certificate can be used for:

- Check our work history
- File tax returns
- Check DGT points
- Check where and since when you're registered
- Legally sign a PDF
- And a very long etcetera

In addition, every day there are more sites where you can perform bureaucratic procedures. And the best of all, is that almost everything is done instantly, without queues or waits.

**Come on, you've convinced me, how do I start?**

Although with the COVID-19 issue, this procedure is being slowed down but it's still working and you must start like this:

You enter the [following link](https://www.sede.fnmt.gob.es/certificados/persona-fisica/obtener-certificado-software), read the previous considerations and fill out the application via Internet (step 2).

![FNMT Certificate Request](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-10-231029.png)

Although the application says that Google Chrome is not a supported browser, it really is. Although it doesn't allow making the application from there.

Once we open it in Firefox or Explorer, the application will appear where we must fill in with our NIF, first surname and an email address to which we have total access (DO NOT CREATE A TEMPORARY EMAIL).

![Certificate Request Form](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-10-231307.png)

As soon as we click send request, we'll receive by email a numeric code that we must present when accrediting our identity in the next step.

The next step is to move away from the digital world and appear in person at a registration office. You can consult all offices [here.](http://mapaoficinascert.appspot.com/) I recommend choosing some office that serves generic areas. If you live in Málaga, like me, I recommend going to the Municipal Housing Institute

The day you propose to go to the office, (generally no appointment is necessary although it depends on the place) you must tell the security guard to notify to request a digital certificate, since, there usually isn't any queue or desk to get exclusively this type of certificates but they're opened as needed.

Once you're at the desk with the official, they'll search the government database for your file and ask you for the code you've received by email. That's the moment to give it to them. Then you can delete it because it won't be necessary anymore (still I tell you that I just in case still have it saved). Once you give it to them and go home, you'll have received an email with another code to finally download that file.

Watch out, you have to download the certificate on the same computer and with the same browser with which you made the application. Although later you'll be able to export the certificate to all browsers and/or computers you want.

Finally, the certificate will be downloaded and depending on the browser, it may even be installed.

**You said that in Google Chrome you can install the digital certificate, how is it done?**

Well, really, Google Chrome doesn't support certificates, but uses Internet Explorer's certificate store. Yes, it can be installed in Chrome, but let's talk with properties, above all 😂

What we must do is enter "Settings (icon with three vertical dots) > Type 'certificates' > Enter more". And then the option "Manage certificates" will appear, a window will open with all installed certificates and we'll click on the "Import" option.

Then a simple assistant will appear that will help us perform the installation.

**Ready, I already have it. How do I use it?**

Well, let me see, little internet user, I'm going to explain how to make the request for work history, get the certificate that shows the place and date of residence and how to file tax returns. Although in most systems the operation is very similar

If you've ever had a doubt about where you're registered, the procedure that [the INE](https://sede.ine.gob.es/padronciudadano/pages/frmPresentacion.xhtml) provides seems to me, without a doubt, the best. Although depending on the purpose, it may not be valid.

We simply authenticate using the Cl@ve platform and automatically receive the information in web format with the possibility of downloading it in PDF.

![INE Padrón](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-11-135147.png)

To file tax returns, regardless of the year, we must go to the [following link](https://www2.agenciatributaria.gob.es/wlpl/BUCV-JDIT/AutenticaDniNieContrasteh?ref=%2Fwlpl%2FOVCT%2DCXEW%2FSelectorAcceso%3Fref%3D%252Fwlpl%252FDASR%2DCORE%252FAccesoCO2019RVlt%26aut%3DCPR)

![Tax Agency](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-11-135319.png)

Then, we choose the digital certificate option. We click accept and start doing it.

Be careful to differentiate between draft and submitting it definitively, once submitted there's no going back. Look twice at everything you click because if not maybe you end up having to pay and you shouldn't 😂🤞

Finally, to get the work history report we must go to the [following link](https://sede.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/sede/sede/Ciudadanos/CiudadanoDetalle/!ut/p/z0/fYxLDoIwFACvwob1a4U0smRhGvwsjCFiN6RpH-T5aYVWo7cXOIDLmUwGFDSgnH5TryN5p-8TX5RoMy5yXjC-l6zasLI-7OoiO2ay4nDCAFtQ_6PpQtdhUCUo413ET4QmoMV2IUfWh5TNImWGXlZb7WZDrvPjA0PyTQyOkToyeklXjK9FDs-bPP8AWCkbgQ!!/) and scroll down to select the electronic certificate option

And that would be all guys, leave me in the comments what you thought and if you have any doubts, I'll solve them in less than a rooster crows 😂🐓
