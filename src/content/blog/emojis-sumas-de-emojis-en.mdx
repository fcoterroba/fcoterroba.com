# did you know some emojis are just sums of other emojis?

❤️ + 🔥 = ❤️‍🔥

It might seem simple, but behind that burning heart emoji, there's a super interesting tech trick.

Hello world, my name is Francisco, **fcoterroba** on the internet, and today I want to dive deeper into a video I just uploaded to TikTok about how emojis aren't always what they seem.

<iframe src="https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/7599385226199960854" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" style="border-radius: 20px; margin: 2rem 0;"></iframe>

## what is the Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ)?

For two emojis to "merge" into one, we need a special glue. In computing, this glue is called the **Zero Width Joiner** (or ZWJ for short).

It's an invisible character (Unicode `U+200D`) that tells the device: "hey, don't render these two emojis separately, join them and see if there's a combined version."

## examples of emoji "sums"

I'm sure you've used them a thousand times without knowing they were a sum:

- **heart on fire:** ❤️ + [ZWJ] + 🔥 = ❤️‍🔥
- **families:** 👨 + [ZWJ] + 👩 + [ZWJ] + 👧 = 👨‍👩‍👧
- **professions:** 👩 + [ZWJ] + 💻 = 👩‍💻 (woman technologist)
- **hair colors:** 👨 + [ZWJ] + 🦰 = 👨‍🦰 (man with red hair)

If your phone or computer is old and doesn't recognize the combination, you'll simply see the emojis separately. This is what we call an elegant *fallback*.

## why is it done this way?

Imagine if for every family combination, every skin tone, and every profession, we had to create a unique code in the Unicode standard. It would be infinite!

By using sums, the standard stays lightweight and allows for enormous flexibility. It's basically programming applied to font design.

I hope that from now on, when you send a ❤️‍🔥, you see the "sum" behind it. Don't forget to follow me on my social media for more tech curiosities. See you in the next post!
