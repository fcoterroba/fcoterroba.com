Hello world 🤟🏻 my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where I, along with two other people, are going to debate, comment, and explain how the second year has been in our respective higher degree training cycles in the computer science family. 👨🏻‍💻

Remember that you have the first part, explaining the first year of these training cycles. [You can read it here](https://fcoterroba.com/que-se-da-en-primero-de-dam-daw-asir)

Before we begin, I must remind you that a while ago, I uploaded a video to my YouTube channel where I explained, in a very simple and concise way, how to install a smart light bulb 🧠 with which you can change its color, control it with your own voice, and much more! You can watch it here 👇🏻

Now let's begin.

**DAW (Web Application Development)**

I'm doing the higher degree in DAW in distance mode, at an Almeria institute. And as far as I can say, the experience is being fabulous for me.

It's true that it's not for everyone, because the student must have control over their hours since there are no classes, as such. Teachers open new topics from various subjects from time to time and you, at your own pace, do the activities, read the syllabus, and take topic exams.

But we haven't come to talk about studying at a distance, but about the cycle itself.

Both DAW and DAM share the same first year, and it's in the second year when they diversify, specializing in each specific part.

We're going to skip the EIE (Business and Business Initiative) subject since it's a subject present in all higher and intermediate training cycles.

The specific subjects (and my point of view on them) of the second year are:

- **DWEC (Web Development in Client Environment)**
  If you're already a bit into web development, this subject is basically front-end.
  JavaScript and jQuery have been learned using "MVC", object-oriented programming, etc.

- **DWES (Web Development in Server Environment)**
  Like the previous point, this subject is back-end.
  You learn to handle the PHP programming language, hearing very briefly about current frameworks and working a bit with Twig. Regardless, we work with OOP and with MVC.

- **DAW (Web Application Deployment)**
  A subject focused more on SysAdmin and, in my opinion, a small nod so that, if you like this subject, you do ASIR since in this subject you see everything a SysAdmin or DevOps does, from doing the deploy, handling security directives in Linux, etc.

- **DIW (Web Interface Design)**
  We could also call this front-end since, in this subject, CSS is covered in quite depth.
  Everything that is pure CSS is explained (and quite well) in this module. Flexbox, Grid, we hear about Bootstrap briefly, we use keyframes, native CSS 3d, and of course the basics.

Hello! My name is [Diego](https://twitter.com/imgranah) and I'm a multiplatform application development student in Málaga. Specifically at the I.E.S Portada Alta institute in face-to-face mode.

I'll talk about my experience, which is also a bit linked to the fact that it was face-to-face, that is, we had to attend class. But as you know with the pandemic and confinement, we were confined in the last trimester and so we did classes remotely.

Something I've noticed and that can be an advantage or disadvantage is that remotely in my case I made better use of time, but I have seen that in other cases it wasn't like that. So studying at a distance is not for everyone and it's something each person must reflect on.

Let's get to the focus of the matter, the subjects I've taken during this course:

- **Interface Development**
  In this module is where we focused on native Android application development. Specifically we used the Java language, and we went from creating simple interfaces to connecting them with databases or REST services

- **Programming and Mobile Devices**
  In my center, this module was a bit special, because they focused it on game development. Therefore, we were developing different games with Unity, using C# as the language

- **Service and Process Programming**
  This module focuses on teaching us the concepts of programs that use different services, processes, threads, etc... The language was Java, where we applied all these concepts and created different programs that consume different threads, services, processes, and even network protocols like TCP or UDP.

- **Data Access**
  This module our teacher focused on creating backend-oriented applications. And exercises were done in two languages, PHP and Java. It focused on data access, so concepts were given from file access, databases, third-party services (APIs). A very necessary module if later in your professional life you want to focus your career on backend.

The modules that have served me most for companies have been Data Access, because I'm currently a backend developer, and Interface Development, which is based on creating native Android applications, a market that is also growing a lot currently.

Good afternoon! For those who don't come from the second part, let me introduce myself, I'm Manuel Jesús Flores ([@_manueljesus00](https://twitter.com/_manueljesus00)) and I'm a computer engineering student and ASIR technician.

Now, how does second year of ASIR work? Remember that we come from a first year of physical, database, systems, programming, and networks, but now, in my opinion, it's about seeing where we apply each thing. For this, I'll detail it subject by subject.

- **Operating System Administration**
  In this subject you'll find out about how to manage a Windows and Linux server. If I talk to you about Windows, I'll tell you that you'll learn to manage Active Directory thoroughly, administer permissions, trust relationships, or configure roles, but if we go to Linux, you touch scripting, process or file administration.

- **Network and Internet Services**
  Basically here you'll learn to deploy all the known services that make the internet simple for everyone. DHCP, FTP, HTTP, DNS, IRC, or webmail will be services you'll learn both to set up and monitor in this subject.

- **Web Application Implementation**
  We've already learned to set up a system and set up services. Now, here you'll learn to set up web applications and manage them, whether Blogger, WordPress, Joomla, or touch code with JavaScript, MySQL, or PHP. Also, you'll integrate databases and touch web office suites or scripts to automate administration tasks for these applications.

- **Database Management System Administration**
  In this module you'll learn what a database management system is like Oracle 12c or PostgreSQL, do administration, maintenance, and security tasks, plan, monitor, and optimize the actions that are executed, and they'll teach you to program in PL/SQL, a scripting language for SQL tasks.

- **Security and High Availability**
  Here you'll know how to create a secure network, implement firewalls in networks and create DMZ, install and maintain a proxy, you'll learn to manage RAID and analyze network traffic, design security systems both passive and active, physical and digital, and manage a contingency plan like a data protection policy. In my opinion, the legislative part gets a bit dense, but it's easy if you put your mind to it.

To finish, I'd like to tell you one thing and that is don't get discouraged if you don't find work right after finishing the cycle. We've been through (and are still going through) a pandemic that has paralyzed many existing jobs and which in turn has given more value to our profession, systems administration. And if you find yourself like me who in his day didn't know what to do after ASIR, don't rule out engineering. It sounds complicated, it is, but today I can say I'm proud to have chosen it (and I don't come from high school).

And that's all for today, guys! I hope you liked it and above all, I hope it helped you choose your path since, sometimes, the decision being so broad, it's complicated to choose.

I also hope you have a great week and we'll see each other here soon!
