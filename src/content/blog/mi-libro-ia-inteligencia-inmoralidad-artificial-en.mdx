Hello world 👋, my name is Francisco — fcoterroba on the internet — and today I'm sharing news that makes me really happy.

As the title says, I wrote a book about artificial intelligence.

In this post, I'll talk about the book, what motivated me to write it, what it's about, who it's for, some easter eggs, and much more.

Before we begin, here's a video from my YouTube channel showing the installation of smart bulbs that can be controlled with Google Assistant or a phone. In case you haven't seen it yet:

Before starting, here's my latest TikTok, where I briefly talk about the book. I hope you like it — and feel free to follow me to stay updated with the latest news on the site.

## AI: Artificial Intelligence or Artificial Immorality?

**_AI: Artificial Intelligence or Artificial Immorality?_** is the title of my first book — a book that wouldn't have been possible without the people who helped me create it.

- Nuria
- Roxas
- Nono
- Daniel
- Diego

Thank you from the bottom of my heart ❤️ — this wouldn't have been possible without you.

## What's the book about?

As the title (I believe) clearly suggests, it's a book of intent. A book that seeks to be read and discussed — one that deserves to be read.

That may sound a bit bold, but I truly believe it.

We live in a hyperconnected, hyper-updated world. We hear futuristic news every week, yet **NOBODY** has set a clear tone on something so delicate, risky and full of opportunities to improve our daily lives: AI ethics.

In the book, we cover various aspects of AI as it gets closer to our daily lives, and how we should approach these advances.

Let's try a real exercise. Picture a not-so-distant world — say, in a decade.

Do you see it as realistic that AI will capture our emotional subtleties? Do you think they could become companions like in _Westworld_?

If you answered yes to both, do you find it ethical? Is it ethical to allow machines to share those deeply personal emotional spaces?

These and many other questions are considered in the book from an impartial standpoint. The book doesn't take a stance; I **do not** give my opinion. The goal is to spark a serious, global consensus on the development of artificial intelligence — a **BASIC** requirement to progress with sanity, education, respect and safety.

## Who is the book for?

The book is for absolutely everyone.

It's for Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, the developers behind GitHub Copilot, city councils adopting AI in public services...

And it's also **FOR YOU**. For you who used ChatGPT to summarize a task at work or school. For you who generated an image with DALL‑E for a presentation. For you, developer, who contributed a small translation to Llama prompts.

In short, the book is for anyone who has had even minimal contact with AI. It's not a technical book (the most “advanced” term used is “prompt”); it's a philosophical take — a technological essay meant to be widely read. We're all part of this revolution, so it must be a democratic process.

We all use AI — therefore, we must all help define its future.

## Extras

Below are the book's images in full color. I hope you like them:
