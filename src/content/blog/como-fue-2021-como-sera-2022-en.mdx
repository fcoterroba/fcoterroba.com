Hello world 🤟🏻 my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post that's a bit out of the ordinary because, as you know, on my website I talk almost exclusively about computer science, programming, and development. But today is a bit different, today, the last day of the year, I'm going to make a small summary of how 2021 has been and what expectations I have for 2022.

Before we begin, as it couldn't be otherwise, if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you go watch the latest video I have on my YouTube channel where I explained, in a very simple and concise way, how to install a smart light bulb 🧠 with which you can change its color, control it with your own voice, and much more! You can watch it here 👇🏻

Now let's begin:

**January 2021**

The year began practically finishing that training course I told you about. From the Junta de Andalucía. We had only a few weeks left to finish and we were all more focused on having a good internship company than anything else.

Also, I had to keep submitting projects for the higher degree and sometimes I even complained:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Tweet hacia todos los usuarios de Aulas Virtuales basadas en Moodle:<br><br>¿No os parece una idiotez que esté la opción de entregar una tarea en borrador?<br>¿No sería mejor acaso que la tarea se quede enviada y se pueda editar hasta la fecha límite?<br>O mejor aún, un sistema basado en Git</p>&mdash; fcoterroba (@fcoterroba) <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba/status/1352741938416463873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I also had time to write a post about web scraping in Python that you can read [here](https://fcoterroba.com/proyecto-python-medio-que-es-webscrapping-como-realizarlo).

**February 2021**

This month the first exams of the higher degree approached, I couldn't study much but I did really well

![Exam results](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

Officially this month I also finished the training course from the junta and started, with great enthusiasm and finally, my first stage as a professional web developer. I was at [Ideanto,](https://ideanto.com/) a Malaga SME in charge of web design for other companies, mostly public companies. I worked as a full-stack developer creating plugins, front and back development, etc. We worked to bring to market a product of virtual 3D fairs accessible via the web.

Although I was working at Ideanto, I always thought I couldn't close my doors and so I kept sending my resume to job offers I saw or were shared with me. (Joaquín has been one of my best discoveries of 2021)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p dir="ltr" lang="es">Gracias Joaquín!</p>— fcoterroba (@fcoterroba) <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba/status/1359442131752992777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was also able to contribute to the Spanish Python association:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">¡Nueva sección en nuestra web sobre cómo aprender Python 🐍! Con enlaces a multitud de cursos 🧑‍🏫 y libros 📚.<br><br>👏 muchas gracias <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@fcoterroba</a> por el currazo!!<a href="https://t.co/R0fhbbIZts">https://t.co/R0fhbbIZts</a></p>&mdash; Python España (@python_es) <a href="https://twitter.com/python_es/status/1361219191802527745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Finally, that month I was able to upload a post about browser extension development. You can read it [by clicking here](https://fcoterroba.com/extensiones-de-navegador-que-son-como-programar-tu-extension-para-chrome-y-firefox).

**March 2021**

March didn't have much special about it but still, I started two new aspects in my professional life:

One of them was starting to work as a Python teacher in a personalized online class for adults. We went from the most basic of the language to some libraries like NumPy or Pandas. I learned that I liked teaching more than I thought!

On the other hand, I began my long career at Newe, a fabulous startup that has given me many joys and from which I've been able to learn a lot. I was there as a back-end developer mainly in PHP.

I also kept looking for work because I wanted something "serious":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Puedes abrir md?</p>&mdash; fcoterroba (@fcoterroba) <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba/status/1370365753023725574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

That said, you also have to know when to stop and that's why that month there was no post:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Durante casi todo el día d hoy he sentido levemente el síndrome del impostor.<br><br>Estoy intentando llevar muchas cosas hacia delante e intento que todas vayan genial pero hay días que... Uf, para qué</p>&mdash; fcoterroba (@fcoterroba) <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba/status/1376614636448014340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**April 2021**

In April things stayed the same, I had one month left to finish my internship at Ideanto and two months for the final exams. I kept looking for serious work:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Hablamos por DM, Marcos?</p>&mdash; fcoterroba (@fcoterroba) <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba/status/1387077838239637505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

That said, the first day of the month marked one year since the website was born and as it couldn't be otherwise, I uploaded a post making [charts in javascript.](https://fcoterroba.com/primer-cumple-web-1-representar-graficos-usando-javascript)

NEWE was starting to appear in media like [eldiariodesevilla](https://www.diariodesevilla.es/suplementotecnologico/Clothify-startup-conquista-mercado-alquiler_0_1554145464.html), [businessinsider](https://www.businessinsider.es/clothify-startup-permite-marcas-alquilar-prendas-821825) and [ABC de Sevilla](https://sevilla.abc.es/economia/sevi-lista-32-nuevas-empresas-y-startup-aterrizado-parque-cientifico-y-tecnologico-cartuja-202103292257_noticia.html) (formerly called Clothify). That month the company name was officially changed:

**May 2021**

In May I finished my internship at Ideanto taking with me great people and with a lot of learning to give my best in a new company:

<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6797437131162693632" allowfullscreen title="Embedded post" width="504" height="812" frameborder="0"></iframe>

As one door closes, another opens and that's why I started taking care of a website as a WordPress developer for Alberto, a very good friend I met in the training program and who I'll have forever. [The website in question](https://kioscolacenachera.es/)

NEWE kept appearing in media like [COPE](https://www.cope.es/emisoras/pais-vasco/noticias/san-sebastian-moda-festival-primavera-verano-celebrara-del-mayo-presencialmente-online-20210422_1250989)

And of course, it was my girlfriend's birthday, a very complete weekend where we went to visit the wonderful town of Frigiliana. A town with beautiful charm that is worth visiting at least once in your life.

![Frigiliana](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

**June 2021**

In June NEWE managed to be part of PcComponentes' startup booster. We were finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6807964446162485248" allowfullscreen title="Embedded post" width="504" height="708" frameborder="0"></iframe>

For the website I uploaded a second part of the previous post but programming it in Python instead of javascript! [Read it here](https://fcoterroba.com/primer-cumple-web-2-representar-graficos-usando-python)

Finally, but no less important, I took the final exams of the degree and went into summer in the best possible way!

![Final exams](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

It was also my birthday

![Birthday](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

**July 2021**

In summer I decided to try different languages that were outside my personal scope and that's why on July 5th I uploaded a post with [things about Rust](https://fcoterroba.com/rust-que-lenguaje-es-por-que-todo-hablando).

I kept applying to job offers although I didn't find anything yet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Por favor, dónde puedo postular? ☹️</p>&mdash; fcoterroba (@fcoterroba) <a href="https://twitter.com/fcoterroba/status/1412685148676628480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I have to make a special mention to my girlfriend, of whom I'm very proud and who that same Friday, July 2nd, got her precious driver's license!

We also went on a weekend getaway to Seville! Computer scientists also know how to disconnect

**August 2021**

August was a bit weak, more of a rest. The only notable thing I did was upload a post on August 4th, a basic PHP project where I explained how to make a [basic CRUD](https://fcoterroba.com/proyecto-php-basico-como-hacer-crud-mejor-manera-posible).

**September 2021**

Possibly one of the best months of my year and not only for having made a post about [javascript using GitHub Pages](https://fcoterroba.com/proyecto-javascript-medio-letra-dni-deploy-github-pages) but because I started working at a new company, Avature!

Obviously I had to say goodbye to NEWE, a company where after half a year we learned a lot and which to this day continues with a brutal project!

<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6840568295880445953" allowfullscreen title="Embedded post" width="504" height="610" frameborder="0"></iframe>

We also went to see a Málaga match where we won 2-0!

![Málaga match](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

**October 2021**

One of the most notable things about that month (although off-topic) was the month and a half binge where my girlfriend and I played through both The Last of Us games. Highly recommended!

I also uploaded a post where I compared, along with two friends, the second year of each computer science training cycle. [Read it here!](https://fcoterroba.com/segundo-curso-daw-vs-dam-vs-asir)

Coincidentally, a few months earlier a drive-in cinema opened in Málaga! And on Halloween night they showed The Nightmare Before Christmas, a movie we love and of course we couldn't miss seeing it!

**November/December 2021**

I've combined the last two months of the year because they've been a bit standard. I kept working and my girlfriend managed to finish her higher degree in tourism.

I had "resolutions" that I set last year and that have been fulfilled to a greater or lesser extent:

![2021 resolutions](/blog/covers/wordpress_to_astro_EN.png)

The first tweet was a joke, although, I started the year with 200€ in the account and ended with more than I wanted, not bad for having collected one month of unemployment and 4 paychecks at Avature.

The tweet I put about learning ASIR I haven't fulfilled, I haven't had much time to work on things that aren't programming.

The last one, which was a bit more serious:

- I haven't been able to give a talk although I'm still interested
- I haven't had time to create any API but I have a very good idea
- I've contributed a lot thanks to the Spanish Python association which helped me throughout the Hacktoberfest process
- From the higher degree I only have to finish the project and validate the internships next year.
- My clean code has improved a lot since I've been at Avature.

**What do I expect for 2022?**

For next year I would love:

- **Health:** We've already been living with COVID-19 in our lives for two years and luckily no close family member has ever caught it. Let's hope it stays that way
- **Work:** Both for me, to continue doing well at Avature, and for my girlfriend, who will study for civil service exams this year.
- **Money:** I would be satisfied if within a year my bank account has 5 digits.
- **Give a talk:** I would love to be able to give a talk about development. I want to be someone who will be remembered for what they did
- **Develop an API**
- **Do more sports:** Right now I don't do any sports but I'm going to propose, at least, to transport myself more by bike and less by car/motorcycle

And that's all for today. Thanks for such a good year, for reading me, for putting up with me, and for making me happy. You're incredible.
