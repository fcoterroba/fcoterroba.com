Hello world 👋 my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I bring you a post in which I am going to talk about forms and PHP.
A pretty bad developer joke could come out of here but we are going to abstain from it (**Explanation for NON-computer scientists**: PHP is considered one of the most hated programming languages although, if I can be honest, I don't understand why). 🤣
Seriously now, in this post, very quick and simple, we are going to learn what forms are, how to make them correctly, where to point them, how to add a captcha so that our inbox doesn't fill up with robots 🤖.

And yes, we will also learn how to make them beautiful using some of the most famous CSS frameworks 🎨. I must emphasize this part since I know firsthand that most back-end developers suffer in this part. 🤣

And the thing is, unlike using different CMS like Wordpress, once we have the design of our page (whether it is a template, commissioning it or designing it), we will only have to worry about knowing how to configure a form plugin and server correctly. The design is another story 🚶‍♂️.

You should know that many of the things we are going to talk about in this post are perfectly explained in a post I uploaded more than a month ago, in which I explain many of the most used computer terms in our day to day. 🤯 **[You can read the post here](https://fcoterroba.com/diccionario-tecnologico-informatico)**.

Before starting, I also want to remind you that a few weeks ago I uploaded a video to my YouTube channel, very interesting, focused on home automation. Specifically, we connect, configure and install a smart bulb 💡 with which you can change its color, turn it off, turn it on and much more simply by using your mobile phone and/or voice assistants like Google, Alexa, etc. 👇🏻

**PREVIOUS STEPS:**

Before starting to understand what a form is, how to apply designs to it and much more, you have to know that PHP is not just another language.

PHP is a language that runs on the server side, unlike JavaScript which runs on the client.

That PHP is a server language means that it cannot be executed until a specific program is available. Those programs are known as **servers.**

I talked about servers a while ago and, so as not to fill the post so much, I recommend that before continuing, if you don't already have it installed, you read the post and install it. Doing their respective tests. **[You can read the post here](https://fcoterroba.com/como-crear-un-servidor-web-local-en-windows) 👈**

**WHAT IS A FORM?**

[Although I explained it in the WordPress post, it never hurts to explain it again:](https://fcoterroba.com/wordpress-que-como-formularios-captcha)

A form is a document, (although in our world it is digital) that serves mainly as an approach between clients and companies, or rather between users and developers.

Specifically, I (and probably 100% of the pages you visit) have a section on the web that is exclusively that, a page with a contact form. [Try it if you want!](https://fcoterroba.com/contacto)

It doesn't have much more history so, let's start with the PHP part👇

**DESIGN AND REALIZATION OF THE FORM WITHOUT CAPTCHA**

In this same post, three "programming" languages are going to be involved. I put the quotes since HTML and CSS, languages that we will use in this post, are not considered as such.

The steps to follow are the following, but, I recommend you read before a post I made a while ago in which I taught how to make a **dark-mode** button for your web page. There I explain perfectly the beginning of this realization. **[You can read it here](https://fcoterroba.com/como-hacer-dark-mode-en-tu-web-codigo) 👈**

**1. Make the HTML of the page (although it will have a PHP extension)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--Tag used to explain to the browser the type of document-->
<html> <!--Tag for the beginning of the HTML -->
    <head> <!--Tag for the beginning of the header-->
        <title>Forms in PHP | fcoterroba.com</title> <!--Tag to title the window-->
        <meta charset="UTF-8"></meta> <!--Tag to establish allowed characters-->
    </head> <!--Tag for the closing of the header-->
    <body> <!--Tag for the beginning of the body -->
        <h1>Hello world</h1><!--Tag to write a level 1 header-->
    </body> <!--Closing of the body-->
</html> <!--End of document-->
```

**2. Form creation**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Forms in PHP | fcoterroba.com</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"></meta>
    </head>
    <body>
<!--Tag to indicate beginning of form | With action we select the file that will appear after the send button-->
<!--The post method is so that what we write does not appear in the search bar-->
<!--With the id we give an identifier in the form of a name to the form-->
        <form action="index.php" method="post" id="formulario">
            <label for="name">Name: <!--The label serves to identify each input as long as they have the same for/id-->
                <input type="text" id="name"> <!--Text type input-->
            </label><!--Closing of the label-->
            <br><br><!--Line breaks-->
            <label for="subname">Surnames: 
                <input type="text" id="subname">
            </label>
            <br><br>
            <label for="mail">Email: 
                <input type="email" id="mail"><!--Email type input-->
            </label>
            <br><br>
            <label for="asunto">Subject: 
                <input type="text" id="asunto">
            </label>
        </form><!--End of form-->
        <br>
        <label for="msg">Write your message...</label>
        <br>
        <textarea id="msg" form="formulario"></textarea><!--Textarea type input, for long and large writings-->
      	<br>
        <input type="submit" form="formulario"></input> <!--Input to establish a finish button-->
    </body>
</html>
```

**3. Form design**

We are going to use a CodePen.io that I have seen from David Fitas with a pretty cool vintage touch. If you copy and paste directly to style.css it doesn't look exactly the same but it gives it the necessary air to be able to continue.

<iframe height="288" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Vintage Inspired Contact Form" src="https://codepen.io/dfitzy/embed/VepqMq?height=288&theme-id=light&default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/dfitzy/pen/VepqMq'>Vintage Inspired Contact Form</a> by David Fitas
  (<a href='https://codepen.io/dfitzy'>@dfitzy</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

And with this we would have finished making the form. 🤓

**ADD CAPTCHA**

To add the captcha it is as simple as adding the following line of code where we want the Captcha to appear.

Obviously, we must replace **your_site_key** with the public API KEY offered by Google.

```html
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>
```

And this would be all for today, guys. 🖖
