Hello world 👋🏻 my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where I'm going to show you the simplest way to make and upload stickers to Telegram and WhatsApp, probably, the two most used instant messaging applications worldwide.

This post is not very computer-related, nor very technological nor very related to programming. But it's something, at least, curious. 🤓

And that, for sure, at some point in your life you've thought about how to make your own stickers either for laughs, to increase views of a personal brand and/or business, etc. 👀

The use that can be given to stickers, or "pegatinas" if we "Spanishize" it, is immense. From some small infographic to a meme passing through people, flags, letters, etc. 🚩

There are many applications in the Android and Apple Store that do a basic function but, in this very quick post, I'll teach you how to do it from the safest place in the world, your computer. 💻

You should know that many of the things we're going to talk about in this post is perfectly explained in a post I uploaded more than a month ago, where I explain many of the most used computer terms in our daily lives. 🤯 **[You can read the post here](https://fcoterroba.com/diccionario-tecnologico-informatico)**.

Before we begin, I also want to remind you that a few weeks ago I uploaded a video to my YouTube channel, very interesting, focused on home automation. Specifically, we connected, configured, and installed a smart light bulb 💡 with which you can change its color, turn it off, turn it on, and much more simply by using your mobile phone and/or voice assistants like Google, Alexa, etc. 👇🏻

**WAIT, WHAT IS A STICKER?**

A sticker, or as I told you before, 'pegatina', in Spanish, is nothing more than another form of expression in instant messaging. 📨

Wikipedia defines it as:

> A **sticker** (from English *sticker*​) is an illustration of a character that represents an emotion or an action, with a style typically inspired by cartoons or Japanese *emojis*. They offer greater variety than emoticons and are based on Internet culture of "reaction through faces", given their ability to represent body language and facial reaction. Stickers are elaborate emoticons, based on characters, and allow informal communication through extravagant animations

Just as there are GIFs, those images with movement without audio that we sometimes use for images, videos, etc. Or those yellow emoticons that, due to racial bias, we've divided with more colors. Stickers are simply one more thing.

The sticker trend began in 2011 when LINE, the default instant messaging company in China invented these illustrations.

Generally, a sticker is usually free to download and without rights beyond the image **but,** today, LINE has an online store to buy these stickers with high amounts of money.

After LINE, they were followed by Messenger, Allo, Hangouts, Telegram and finally, lastly WhatsApp.

So yes, as you read and as you can already imagine, WhatsApp doesn't innovate in anything, it just copies.

But that, I already said it with the animated stickers topic 👇🏻

After this brief hate pause 🔪, we continue 😁

**IMAGES I'M GOING TO USE**

These are the images I'm going to use momentarily. They're a bit shabby but let's get to it! 🍫

Once we have the images and/or GIFs selected to make stickers and animated stickers let's start with WhatsApp!

**UPLOAD STICKERS TO WHATSAPP**

WhatsApp, as always, does things in the most difficult way possible and that's why this time is no less and the simplest way, without making our head hurt, is to download some application from our app store.

I, specifically on Android use [WeMoji](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picmax.wemoji&hl=es&gl=US). Free application with more than 10 million downloads.

When we have it downloaded and installed we'll simply go to the application and the process is as follows: **Create Sticker > Add image > Crop if necessary > Set a name for the sticker pack**

And when you finish it will ask you if you want to add the ***name of your sticker pack*** to WhatsApp. You say yes and the program will do the rest! 😁

**UPLOAD STICKERS TO TELEGRAM**

Now yes, here comes the good stuff!

To upload a sticker to Telegram is much much much simpler.

From your usual Telegram client, you must open a new chat with Telegram's official sticker bot. [@Stickers](https://telegram.me/stickers)

Once you open that conversation you're going to press the button to start or write /start.

Everything comes perfectly explained but if we want to make a new sticker pack we must write (or press) the first option, the one for **/newpack**

Then, we'll write the name of the sticker pack.

Now, we're going to send the image we want to have that yes, **AS A FILE, in PNG FORMAT and WITH TRANSPARENCY.**

To finish, Telegram asks you for an emoji that relates to that sticker. It asks this for the mere fact that this application has a function which is to show Stickers according to the emojis you write or search for stickers by emojis.

After that, we'll have to repeat the process for each sticker we want to add. When we want to finish, we'll simply write /publish in this last step.

To finish, it asks for a short name for the pack to also create a link where people can download that pack.

And voilà! Sticker made for Telegram
