Hello world my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where I'm going to comment on what my PC is like, what components I have installed and what programs I use.

**HARDWARE:**

Well guys, in the hardware part, which in case you don't know, hardware is all that structure that provides physical support to the computer. That is, everything you can touch from a computer. The physical.

Before everything I want to warn that what you're going to see is not a configuration for a state-of-the-art computer, prepared for gaming or video editing. I use the computer to study and program so I don't need very good components, just enough.

Now yes, let's start from the deepest, the microprocessor.

I have a [Intel Core i5-4590](https://amzn.to/2VusZi6) fourth generation that runs at 3.3GHz.
As for motherboard, thanks to my girlfriend, I use the ASUS H81M-C. A normal board for LGA 1150 sockets with two DDR3 sockets.
For RAM memory I have 2x4GB DDR, obviously. From the [HyperX Fury](https://amzn.to/3cfG59K) brand at 1600MHz
The graphics card my computer has is a [Gigabyte GT 710](https://amzn.to/2y82x62) 2GB GDDR5. More than enough for what I play (nothing 😂)
The hard drive I have is a [Toshiba DT01ACA100](https://amzn.to/2V6aFgm) 1TB. (later we'll see how I have it partitioned).
To finish the computer, we arrive at the case. I was looking for something with a power supply included and the [Tacens Anima AC4500](https://amzn.to/2XsxaxI) came great with its 500W power supply. (the only drawback is the noise, which makes a bit more than normal)
On the outside, thanks to my partner I have a great pack of RGB mouse and keyboard both and a mouse pad from the [Mars Gaming](https://amzn.to/34z49ls) brand. No complaints, the keyboard has 4 colorful lighting backgrounds and the mouse is in constant lighting in all the colors you can imagine 😂. The mouse pad, if you're not looking for an XXL this one is great.
As for sound, also thanks to my partner I have multiplatform headphones [Ben-gi Beexcellent GM-1](https://amzn.to/3b6HC1J) with red lighting (matching the mouse pad), with more than sufficient volume, ergonomic design to spend hours and hours in front of the computer and several accessories to improve its use outside the computer.
And to finish, although I barely use them, as speakers I use [Mars Gaming MS1](https://amzn.to/2y70yyR) at 10W with jack connection to use wherever I really want.

**SOFTWARE**:

Let's go now to what I like most in computing, the part that's not touched, software.

Software is everything that's left when we set aside hardware: programs, operating systems, etc.

To start, I show you a screenshot of how I have my hard drive partitioned and proceed to explain it.

![Disk partitions](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-25-193816.png)

As you can imagine or see, I have a Multi boot or multi-boot system with two operating systems: Linux (ext4) and Windows (NTFS).

My hard drive is partitioned into 300GB for Windows, 660GB for Linux and 40GB for a data partition (approximate measurements)

Initially I gave more importance to Linux because I used it much more than Windows but now the roles have changed and I use Microsoft's system much more for work and study reasons. Still, I try to use Linux as much as possible. 🖖

I also have a data partition where I store the most vital information in case someday some operating system gets corrupted, I could still access my information and reinstall the operating system. That's why it's in NTFS, because it's a file system accessible from both O.S.

**Linux**

The distribution I currently use (although I like to try them all and change every now and then) is Linux Mint, in its 19.2 Cinnamon version.

![Linux Mint desktop](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-26-124659.png)

As you can see, Linux is not able to recognize my graphics card, but I haven't tried to configure it since I installed the distro more than 6 months ago. Maybe now with the news of NVIDIA software on Linux it will recognize it.

The programs I most often use here are:

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/es_es/chrome/) (both on Windows, Linux and Android)
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (although I barely use it, I have it on Windows and Linux)
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (I practically don't use it, but I also have it on both systems)
The multimedia player I use by default (also on both systems) is [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.es.html), I think it's one of the best. And it's free! 😄
For the terminal, I use [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for its fluidity, extensive customization and its multi-window system.
I use Nautilus as file manager (although you'll always see me navigating through the terminal)
As IDEs, although I have [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) installed, I prefer the latter on Linux and Netbeans on Windows (speaking for working in Java). That's how weird I am 😂
I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as code editor because I think the multitude of plugins available is splendid.
As for office suite, I use [LibreOffice](https://es.libreoffice.org/) although if I can, I use the famous great alternative 🙄. After all, everything goes in PDF 😂
Finally, although it was for a couple of tasks, I have [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) installed to better visualize some database and tinker around.

**Windows**

I have Windows 10 updated to the latest version, as of today. The 1909.

![Windows 10 desktop](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anotación-2020-04-26-130501.png)

Yes, I'm from that small percentage of the population that prefers light mode 😂

The programs I most often use here are:

[360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/). A free antivirus with hardly any advertising and quite complete.
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/es/). Currently, as I told you in my [post, I'm using Amazon Music Unlimited](https://fcoterroba.com/primera-impresion-sobre-amazon-music-unlimited) but it's there, just in case 😂
[QbitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). For the P2P Torrent protocol. That thing we all use for 100% legal things, yes. 😂
[Camtasia Studio 9](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html?utm_source=fastspring&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_content=admitad%20GmbH&irgwc=1&clickid=Qp9Sh2QYQxyJUGuwUx0Mo3E2Uki2N%3A20P2lmTs0). I don't give it much use, but it's there for some time I've had to edit some family video or the like.
[Photoshop.](https://www.adobe.com/es/products/photoshop/free-trial-download.html) I know it's old, but for what I need it, which is to remove the background from a few things and establish a design pattern, it works great for me.
[BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/es/index.html). I use it to test some application I've developed, but almost nothing.
[Office](https://www.office.com/). As I've already commented, I have Office 2016 as office suite to make PDF documents, spreadsheets, etc.
[Hamachi.](https://www.vpn.net/) It's a program to make a kind of LAN network between several computers from different networks. I use it for small server projects with my partner.
[League of Legends](https://play.euw.leagueoflegends.com/es_ES): 🤣 I know you didn't expect it, neither did I 😂 but there it is. Once a month or every two months I usually play some (guess what my name is 😱)
Sometimes unfortunately I have to bring work home and that's why I have [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/es/) installed. Both to connect to my office computer and to connect to clients.
Finally, I think like 90% of computer users, I have [WinRar](https://www.winrar.es/). Although I really don't know why it's used so much, with ZIP files existing. Even with the inconvenience that ZIPs have, their larger size, I don't think it's enough to use a proprietary format like RAR.

And that's all guys, that's the configuration I have on my humble desktop computer 😇

I hope you liked it, leave me in the comments your favorite programs, components and operating systems and don't forget to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fcoterroba), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fcoterroba), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fcoterroba/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcoterroba/) and see you in the next post!
