Hello world, my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you the first (I hope of many) posts on my page.

First of all, I don't know how you got here: SEO, Social networks, YouTube, Podcast. It doesn't matter, I just want to say, that I thank you. I thank you very much for your visit and I hope to see you frequently here 😁

Neither I know you nor you know me so, I'm going to introduce myself:

My name, as I've already said, is Francisco and on the Internet I go by fcoterroba. (it's an ingenious combination of first and last name 😂)

I studied the Intermediate Degree in Microcomputer Systems and Networks (SMR). And, currently, I'm studying a Higher Cycle of Web Application Development (DAW).

In addition, I'm doing internships as a backend web developer at [Ideanto](https://ideanto.com/).

fcoterroba is my personal brand as well as a website (this one you're admiring 😬).

On this website, as you see in the navigation bar there are four sections:

- Home → Page where posts will appear ordered by publication date.
- [Portfolio](https://fcoterroba.com/portafolio) → Its own name defines it, this section is a portfolio where I attach all the courses, jobs and projects I've done. A kind of mini resume in constant update
- [Recommendations](https://fcoterroba.com/recomendaciones) → Website section with weekly update (Mondays) that contains two playlists: One from YouTube, with 30 videos that I find curious/funny/entertaining/terrifying/... and another from Spotify with 30 songs I like. I do this to make known channels and artists that I like and that maybe you could also like.
- [Acknowledgments](https://fcoterroba.com/agradecimientos) → I'm clear that I am who I am today because of many people, considering some even a mentor. And I think they couldn't have less than a small piece of my website. A small tribute. 💚
- [Contact](https://fcoterroba.com/contacto) → Typical form to contact me via email in addition to other forms of contact.

It's not necessary to comment that if you want me to cover any topic in particular you can put it in a comment wherever you want or contact me in the way that's easiest for you.

And that's all friends, leave me in the comments anything and I'll respond gladly as soon as possible.

I remind you to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fcoterroba), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fcoterroba), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fcoterroba/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcoterroba/), [GitHub](https://github.com/fcoterroba/) and contribute economically to the website using [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/fcoterroba). Now yes, I say goodbye until the next post!
