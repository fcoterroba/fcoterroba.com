# how i migrated from wordpress to astro

i remember march 2020 perfectly. the world stopped, the streets were empty, and i, like many others, found myself with plenty of time. but while most people went crazy making sourdough bread or watching netflix until 3 am, i had an idea in my head: create my first personal website.

it wasn't the first time i programmed, but it was the first time i faced creating something completely mine, from scratch, without client or boss restrictions. and wordpress seemed like the obvious choice.

## why wordpress in 2020

wordpress had everything i needed: ease of use, thousands of themes, plugins for everything, and a huge community. plus, i didn't want to complicate my life with complex configurations. i wanted to create content, not fight against code.

so i got to work. i chose a theme, installed some basic plugins, and started writing. my first entry was about programming, as it couldn't be otherwise. and little by little, the website grew.

## the pros and cons of wordpress

### what i loved:
- **ease of use**: i could create content without touching code
- **ecosystem**: plugins for everything i could think of
- **seo**: with yoast seo, positioning was a piece of cake
- **community**: there was always someone who had solved my problem

### what started bothering me:
- **performance**: increasingly slow, heavier
- **updates**: a constant headache
- **security**: always worried about vulnerabilities
- **flexibility**: i felt limited by the cms

## the evolution: from wordpress to astro

four years later, my mindset had changed. i no longer just wanted to create content, i wanted total control over my website. i wanted it to be fast, modern, and reflect exactly what i wanted.

astro appeared on my radar and i fell in love. a modern framework, fast, with native markdown support, and giving me the flexibility that wordpress denied me.

### why astro is perfect for me

**performance**: astro generates super fast static sites. my website now loads in less than 2 seconds, something unthinkable with wordpress.

**simplicity**: i don't need a database, no plugins to maintain, no security updates to lose sleep over.

**flexibility**: i can use react, vue, svelte, or simply html and css. total freedom.

**seo**: with astro, seo is native. i don't need plugins, just good practices.

## the migration: a learning process

migrating from wordpress to astro wasn't just changing platforms, it was a process of personal and professional growth.

i learned about:
- **static site generation**: how it works and why it's the future
- **modern components**: react, but without unnecessary complexity
- **build tools**: vite, which makes development a pleasure
- **deployment**: github pages, netlify, vercel... infinite options

## the lessons learned

### 1. technology is just a tool
wordpress served me perfectly in 2020. astro serves me perfectly in 2025. the key is choosing the right tool for each moment.

### 2. evolution is constant
what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. being open to change is fundamental in our field.

### 3. simplicity is power
sometimes, less is more. astro gives me more with less complexity.

### 4. productivity isn't just doing things
in 2020, creating a website in wordpress was productive. in 2025, migrating to astro is too. productivity is doing the right thing at the right time.

## the future: always evolving

my website will continue to evolve. maybe in two years i'll be using another technology, or maybe astro will still be perfect for me. the important thing is to maintain the mindset of always doing something productive, always learning, always improving.

the pandemic taught me that time is valuable, and that investing it in personal projects is one of the best decisions you can make. my website is more than code, it's my personal space on the internet, my way of connecting with other developers, my way of sharing what i learn.

## conclusions

from wordpress to astro hasn't been just a technical change, it's been a personal evolution. i've learned that technology should serve your goals, not the other way around. i've discovered that simplicity can be more powerful than complexity. and i've confirmed that always doing something productive, even in the most difficult moments, is the best strategy.

if you're thinking about creating your first website, or migrating the one you already have, my advice is simple: start with what you feel comfortable with, but don't stay there. evolve, learn, improve. technology changes, but the growth mindset is forever.
