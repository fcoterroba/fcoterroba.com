Hello world my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm writing you a post similar to last week's, which in case you haven't read it, I strongly recommend it! It deals with [series for technology and computing lovers](https://fcoterroba.com/mejores-series-sobre-informatica-y-tecnologia)

Just as I wrote the previous one, I also write this one so that now that summer is starting, you can relax watching series and movies from your favorite field! 👨🏻‍💻

And as I said last week, in this post several movies will be seen, but it's not a top, it doesn't have an order, I don't like one more than another, simply, I recommend watching them all 👀

**MOVIES**

**Ready Player One** is the first movie I'm going to recommend that, although not expressly related to computing, it is related to technology. 🪐

Ready Player One was originally a novel that my friend, teacher and mentor [M. Ángel Ronda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelangelronda/) made us read in class. Since then, I became even more interested, if possible, in the world of technology and computing. (Recommended reading) 📖

Years later, this homonymous movie came out, quite faithful to the novel.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, written by the novel's author and with actors like Olivia Cooke and Tye Sheridan. The movie honors a utopian future in which reality, speaking plainly, is a 'pain' and life has been reduced to playing and connecting all day to Oasis, a virtual reality world with the freedom to do whatever you wanted.

The end of the movie is to find three easter eggs (keys) that the video game creator has placed somewhere on the infinite map. Whoever gets those three, will become, under contract, owner of Oasis.

I've never seen it in VOSE, but in Spanish it's great.

**Ex Machina** is a 2015 British science fiction movie, written and directed by Alex Garland in his debut in these cinema positions.

The movie tells the story of Caleb, a programmer from a fictional company who receives, as a result of a raffle, the prize of making a visit to the company's uptight president, who claimed to need help in a new artificial intelligence and robotics project.

This movie received that year the Oscar for best visual effects. It's worth it.

Here I leave you the trailer dubbed into Spanish, which has nothing to envy to the original version.

**The Circle** is a 2017 American science fiction and drama movie, which, although written and directed by James Ponsoldt, is based on the homonymous novel by Dave Eggers.

The Circle is a fictional company, similar to Google that hires Mae Holland (Emma Watson) as another programmer. What she perhaps didn't know was that The Circle's policies, the boundary between the network and the personal, was practically transparent.

Mae, will have to gradually get to know the company up close and will try to establish the points, establishing a close relationship with the company's director, played by Tom Hanks.

Here I leave you the trailer ⬇

**The Internship** is a 2013 American comedy directed by Shawn Levy, written by Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern, and produced by Vaughn and Levy.

The Internship is a movie that deals with two salespeople from an old watch company, which, unfortunately, goes bankrupt.

Our two protagonists, need to keep working and then think about Google, which interviews them and they pass to a fictional phase in which, they spend an entire summer together with another group of people, having to pass a series of tests, events and phases in order to be the best team and be able to have a guaranteed full-time job at that company.

**Pirates of Silicon Valley** is a movie written and directed by Martyn Burke. Based on the book "Fire in the Valley: The Making of a Personal Computer" by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine.

The movie deals with the history of the world's two largest technology companies, in their beginnings, when everything was garages. Back in the 70s, with the final scene being the toast at Steve Jobs' famous birthday, when he was fired from the company he himself set up.

100% recommended movie, although computing takes a back seat and drama and the history that occurred comes into action.

**Her** is a 2013 American dramatic and romantic science fiction movie written, directed and produced by Spike Jonze.

In the story we see Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix), a rather lonely man who works as a writer who, sees his heart broken after a long relationship married to the woman he loved (Amy Adams).

After this, he meets an advanced operating system based on artificial intelligence that will try to get closer and learn more about the world and the user who uses it.

Really, computing remains in a very small place, but it's a drama that must be seen at least once in life.

**The Social Network** is a biographical movie directed by David Fincher in 2010.

This movie, probably the most famous of the post, tells the drama of Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) to create Facebook.

The movie, is quite faithful to reality, from that anecdote in Mark's room at Harvard to all the judicial proceedings that the creator of Facebook has had to go through at his 36 years.

100% recommended both in VOSE and dubbed. It received the number one position as the best movie of 2010 in the magazines *Rolling Stone, Metacritic, Washington Post, The New York Times and Los Angeles Times.*
