Hello world my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm writing you a post with a personal recommendation, so that this summer you enjoy a bit more, and relax from work and studies, with a fairly extensive list about **series** related to the field of **technology and computing.**

Before starting, I warn that it's not a top, it's an unordered list, it's a `&lt;ul&gt;` 😂.
That because x comes first and h second, doesn't mean that x I like more than h.
Once explained, we continue ⬇

**SERIES**

**The IT Crowd** (Los informáticos in Spain) was a British sitcom launched in 2006 that dealt with an IT department in a large multinational. What unfolds the life of the two protagonists is the fact of the entry of a new technology boss, who doesn't know about technology but does about personal relationships. Together they'll try to bring both worlds closer, without losing the canned grace that characterizes them.

Although watching it in VOSE wins much more, Canal + made the dubbing and production in Spain, leaving scenes so funny like this:

**Person of Interest** (Vigilados, Person Of Interest in Spain) was an American dramatic series that deals with a programmer who develops an artificial intelligence capable of predicting terrorist acts. In the course of the series reflections such as the incursion of technologies in our daily lives, or how daily life as we know it could end, with the use of new technologies are brought to light.

I've only seen it dubbed into Spanish, when the Spanish private channel La Sexta broadcast this series in open. Here I leave you one of the most iconic scenes of the series:

**Betas** (homonymous name in all languages) was an American webseries produced by Amazon with very satirical comedy tones. The story deals with a group of programmers in a company who develop a dating application, being their first time in the field, in the famous, Silicon Valley.

I don't know if there's a version dubbed into Spanish, but as almost always, the VOSE version wins by far.

**Halt & Catch Fire** (homonymous in all languages) was an American dramatic television series set in the 80s/90s, in the takeoff of the personal computer revolution. As you can appreciate, the series name refers to the fictional machine code developed by IBM with the same name.

I haven't seen it yet, but it's exposed as one of the best series, despite being little known. Still, the trailer, puts the series through the roof. 100% recommended.

**Silicon Valley** (homonymous in all languages) is one of the most famous and well-known series in this field in the world. It was a comedy series premiered in 2014, in which the most common topics present in that park are dealt with; Startups, Big Four, Programming, etc.

I'm missing the last season to finish watching the series and I can tell you, that the dubbing, has nothing to envy to VOSE.

**Mr. Robot** (homonymous in all countries) is another of the most famous series in the field. It was a series hard to define, since it has utopian, cyberpunk, dramatic, hackfilm, thriller, comedy points, etc.
The story deals with a computer security worker in the company that practically, owns the world. Weeks later, a revolutionary hacktivist group tries to contact him to unseat the company the protagonist works with.

Both VOSE and the version dubbed into Spanish, are perfectly in line with the plot of the story.

This is one of the scenes I like most:

**Black Mirror** (homonymous in all countries) is a British dystopian anthology series that deals with various futures that could come to occur, if we don't control technology or it gets out of hand.

Just as I recommend the series, I also recommend the movie, which has been, if not the first, one of the first interactive movies, in which, the person watching the film, can choose the protagonists' decision at all times. Creating a new movie every time it's watched.

Here I leave you the VOSE trailer of the season I've liked most of the series:

And that's been everything for today guys 😁. Put me in the comments your series recommendations, as well as the ones you've added to the list to watch! 👀
