Hello world my name is Francisco, fcoterroba on the Internet and today I'm bringing you a post where I'm going to show you what for me are the best groups, channels and bots that exist today.

Telegram, Whatsapp, Line, WeChat, there are many instant messaging applications that exist today.

**But, what makes Telegram special?**

Well, let me see, I'll try not to seem too fan-boy but, whenever I have to send a message to someone, I first check if they use Telegram. If they do, I send it there, otherwise, I'll have to use the green giant very reluctantly.

The numerous advantages that Telegram has are world-famous, but first, I'll tell you a bit about its history.

Telegram is a messaging and VOIP application developed by Nikolai and Pável Durov, two famous Russian brothers who developed this application.

It's an application that from its beginnings has been free... (suck on that, 1€ per year from Whatsapp 5 years ago!) and they promise to continue being so.

Many of the ideas that today you see in Whatsapp, were previously in Telegram (like stickers). What's more, I'd bet my neck that in a while we'll see animated stickers in Whatsapp when it's everyday in any Telegram conversation.

Additionally, it has features not implemented in the big green like:

- Possibility to talk to people without having their phone number
- Prohibit being added to groups without our consent
- Channels and bots (I'll tell you more about them now)
- Attachments up to 1.5GB
- Secret chats (messages are deleted after a certain time, prevents screenshots and doesn't backup the chat)
- Messages can be deleted (without leaving a record) and even edited.

And many more things. So, really, if you still don't use Telegram, I don't know what you're waiting for 😉.

Now yes, let's get to it.

I'm going to show you the top 7 (always from my point of view) channels, groups and bots on Telegram.

**CHANNELS**

Channels are a tool to broadcast public messages to large audiences. Specifically that number is infinite. You can set up a channel and include all people in the world.

More briefly, a channel is a kind of chat newsletter. ATTENTION, in this type of tools you can't chat, only observe.

The last thing before starting with the list is to clarify how to enter channels. And that is, for this you'll have to type in the search bar the "username" of the channel in question or press the link I leave you in each one, as long as you have Telegram installed. Without further delay, let's begin:

1. First, and as the current situation in Spain is, I want to put the channel [@sanidadgob](https://t.me/sanidadgob). It's the official channel of the Ministry of Health where they upload daily updated figures of COVID-19 cases in addition to sending some files and links to keep us safe. Remember, #stayathome

2. Don't take it as spam but, if you don't know [Los Guardianes Del Tapón](https://t.me/losguardianesdeltapon) (@losguardianesdeltapon), I recommend following them. It's a youtube/podcast channel with live every Thursday where they talk about various topics with a touch of computing. Very funny, I recommend it.

3. [@Xataka](https://t.me/xataka) is a famous Spanish-speaking news website where they define themselves as "passionate about technology". Highly recommended, for its division between news, podcast, YouTube channel, etc.

4. [@nacion_linux](https://t.me/nacion_linux) is a Telegram channel dedicated to computing in general although the tendency here towards the free software world is obvious. Still, highly recommended.

5. We arrive at the hemisphere with [@coinlistES](https://t.me/coinlistES), a channel dedicated to sharing news about cryptocurrencies, blockchain, sector offers and much more. 100% in Spanish!

6. As would be expected, not everything is going to be computing and news, also a bit of [@canalhumor](https://t.me/canalhumor), a channel with several memes and daily videos to brighten your day with humor 😄

If you're a compulsive buyer, skip this last one and go to the next section, your wallet will thank me 😂

And it's true, because if there's something that made Telegram take a leap (at least in Spain), it was discount channels.

7. [@CholloBoom](https://t.me/Cholloboom) is a price compilation channel to save us some euros on purchases 🤑

**GROUPS**

Groups are conversations between 3 or more people that can be separated by areas. To enter groups you need to be added, search for them (as long as they have @) or use the public link to enter.

My favorite public ones are:

1. [LenguajeProgramador.com](https://t.me/joinchat/MrqwBhQDgsmAcWeIilp2BQ): Group dedicated to sharing valuable material and/or helping with topics related to programming. Regardless of language

![LenguajeProgramador.com](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3.png)

2. If yours is specifically Python, you'll love [@PythonESP](https://t.me/pythonesp). Python group 100% in Spanish.

3. If you're 100% maker, you'll love [@Arduchino](https://t.me/arduchino). Group dedicated to sharing Arduino projects and questions.

4. [@GNULinuxgrupo](https://t.me/gnulinuxgrupo) is a group to talk and debate about Linux and all its distributions. It also has 2 channels that might interest you.

5. [@Linuxeros_ES](https://t.me/linuxeros_es) is the self-proclaimed largest Spanish-speaking group of recent times. They offer selfless help about GNU/Linux

6. If you're passionate about the SEO world, [@SoyWebMastercom](https://t.me/soywebmastercom) is the best. Group to talk about everything related to Marketing, Black Hat, Link Building, etc.

7. If instead you're more into graphic design, I recommend [@EdicionGrafica](https://t.me/ediciongrafica). That said, offtopic is strictly prohibited.

**BOTS**

A Telegram bot is a very old functionality, it's more than 3 years old and doesn't have a common explanation since each bot is different and does very different functions from each other.

But it could be summarized by saying that bots are small programs within the same program.

Most of them are in English, but it's very simple. To add it you have to follow the link I leave you below or search for them with @.

1. [@fbvideo_bot](https://t.me/fbvideo_bot). Don't be fooled by its name, this bot is capable of downloading videos from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, imgurl and even reddit using only the link. In 3 seconds it sends you the file so you can download it.

2. [@converto_bot](https://t.me/converto_bot) is a bot that allows you to download mp3 and mp4 from any YouTube video. You simply have to type mp3 or mp4 followed by the link and in less than 1 minute you'll have the link to download it directly.

![Converto Bot](https://fcoterroba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5.png)

3. [@TexttSbot](https://telegram.me/texttsbot) is a bot that allows you to create loquendo voices (computer-generated) in almost any language and without any limit. I don't use it daily but it's funny 😂

4. [@Watch_Bot](https://t.me/watch_bot) is a simple bot that limits itself to constantly observe your website and instantly alerts you of possible crashes. In case you want to say goodbye to hosting a bit 😂

5. If you want to have a fun time, [@Gamee](https://telegram.me/gamee) is your best bot. It's an online minigame page that this bot has created where you can play an infinity of games without leaving Telegram or installing programs.

6. If you're a cryptocurrency machine, [CryptoWhaleBot](https://t.me/CryptoWhaleBot) is your bot. It's a simple bot that gives you the current value of most cryptocurrencies. As well as its balance in 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week. In addition to showing the value of the requested currency in Bitcoins, in case you wanted to do Exchange.

7. [@RaeBot](https://telegram.me/RaeBot) is an UNOFFICIAL bot to consult word definitions according to the RAE, the body that governs Spanish linguistics. Its use is simple, you just have to type @raebot followed by the word you want to see definition. (You can use it in any chat)
